# Simple Encryption Program (SEP)

Just a simple solution for encrypting files (AES) with a basic password, and storing them locally.

### Features

* Encrypt entire files using a password that a key is then derived from.
* Decrypt these files by using the same password.
* Encrypt & Decrypt strings (super basic secret messages).

### Potential Future Features

* Support for 2FA apps.
* Password Library (Password storage, encrypted using authenticator app).
* Incorrect Password Detection (Using verification) - (Maybe a bad idea due to brute force?)

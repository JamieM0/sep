## Welcome Toggle Encryption Program Protocol (TEPP)

Yes, I know that name doesn't make sense.

### Basic Encryption and Decryption works here.

Download the code, run the "Run.bat" file, and follow the instructions.
The program will make a folder in your Documents folder called "TEPPSaves", within this, a new folder will be created when you encrypt something, this new folder will be called the current Date and Time in the format "YYYY.MM.DD.HH.mm.ss", here two text (.txt) files will be created, one with the password that you chose, or was generated, and one with the encrypted text, encrypted by the password.

##### More Information
Read the (White Paper)[https://go.jamielinks.ml/tepp/whitepaper] for more information. I'm learning extremely basic encryption and decryption, so don't expect this to be anything else. Feedback about everything, really, is appreciated.

It should also go without saying, though I will, anyway, that this is purely for my entertainment and enjoyment, it does help me to understand these mechanics better, but it's nothing that I'm taking seriously.

Thanks!
